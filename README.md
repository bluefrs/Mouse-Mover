# Mouse-Mover

V1.0 update:
-GUI added
-Only one moving sequence. Temporary.
-Time interval dropped. Temporary.

Simple command line tool to keep screen on.
Can also be used if you work from home to remain active for your metrics.

Once open choose a value between 5 and 120 to represent the interval from when mouse movement is no longer detected. If movement is detected during that interval the timer will reset.

There are currently 6 movement sequences
